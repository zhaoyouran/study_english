## Do-re-mi
```
Doe, a deer, a female deer 
Ray, a drop of golden sun 
Me, a name I call myself 
Far, a long, long way to run 
Sew, a needle pulling thread 
La, a note to follow Sew 
Tea, a drink with jam and bread 
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh) 
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do 
So-do!

## Twinkle
```
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Then the traveller in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark;
He could not see where to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep,
And often through my curtains peep,
For you never shut your eye
Till the sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark
Lights the traveller in the dark,
Though I know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

## itsy bitsy spider
```
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
