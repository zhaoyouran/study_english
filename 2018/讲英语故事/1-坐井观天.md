There is a frog. He lives in a well and he never goes out of the well. He thinks the sky is as big as the mouth of the well.

--

有一只青蛙住在井底，他从来没有去过井外面。他以为天空就和井口一样大。

---

One day a crow comes to the well. He sees the frog and says, “Frog, let’s have a talk.”

--

一天， 一只乌鸦飞到井边，看见青蛙，就对它说：“青蛙，咱们聊聊吧。”

---

Then the frog asks, “Where are you from?”

--

青蛙就问他：“你从哪里来？”

---

“I fly from the sky,” the crow says.

--

“我从天上上来。”乌鸦说。

---

The frog feels surprised and says, “The sky is only as big as the mouth of the well. How do you fly from the sky?”

--

青蛙惊讶地说：“天空就只有这井口这么大，你怎么会从天上来? ”

---

The crow says, “The sky is very big. You always stay in the well, so you don’t know the world is big.”

--

乌鸦说：“天空很大。只不过你一直呆在井里，所有不知道世界很大。”

---

The frog says, “I don’t believe.”

--

青蛙说：“我不相信。”

---

But the crow says, “You can come out and have a look by yourself.”

--

乌鸦说：“你可以出来，自己看看嘛。”

---

So the frog comes out from the well. He is very surprised. How big the world is!

--

于是青蛙来到井外。他十分惊讶，原来世界这么大！
